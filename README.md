# language_app_3

This is my language learning app. I plan on calling it Lang shor for languages. 
As you can see its organized pretty well if you click all the buttons however right now I'm working 
on a way to add in an auto-complete feature that way users don't have to constantly type in all the responses.

If you can help with that you will be a life saver and I also need to style it better as well and hook it up to a database.

And come up with a payment system and the actual language learning platform as well. Not to mention if all that gets done.
Then I will have to also work on the verbs portion of the website because right now this app is only focusing on nouns for now.

Either way there's a lot of work that needs to be done but with the right amount of help I know I can finish this worthwhile
project.

Thank you for your time.
